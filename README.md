# Loading Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS®) tables on PostgreSQL
![UMLS explan](https://images.slideplayer.com/18/6112070/slides/slide_2.jpg)
These scripts allow us to load all UMLS tables generated by the Metathesarus (RRF files).

The original scripts were found at https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/implementation_resources/community/index.html

Minor modifications were required to some table fields types to accomodate UMLS2018AA.

Developed and tested on: PostgreSQL 9.24 and UMLS2018AA on CentOS 7.
